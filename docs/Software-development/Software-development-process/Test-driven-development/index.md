# Test-driven development



## wikipedia [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

**Test-driven development** (**TDD**) is a [software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process) relying on software requirements being converted to [test cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case) before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
