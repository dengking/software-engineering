应用test的非常成功的案例。

### [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/about.html)

> SQLite is [very carefully tested](https://sqlite.org/testing.html) prior to every release and has a reputation for being very reliable. Most of the SQLite source code is devoted purely to testing and verification. An automated test suite runs millions and millions of test cases involving hundreds of millions of individual SQL statements and achieves [100% branch test coverage](https://sqlite.org/testing.html#coverage). SQLite responds gracefully to memory allocation failures and disk I/O errors. Transactions are [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) even if interrupted by system crashes or power failures. All of this is verified by the automated tests using special test harnesses which simulate system failures. 

测试的**全面性**:
