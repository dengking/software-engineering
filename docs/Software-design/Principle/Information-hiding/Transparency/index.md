# Transparency 

底层的改变不会引起上层的变动，这是一种非常好的性质。最能够体现"transparency"优势的是virtual memory，参见工程Linux-OS的`Kernel\Guide\Memory-management\Virtual-memory`章节。

## wikipedia [Transparency (human–computer interaction)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(human%E2%80%93computer_interaction))

> NOTE: 虽然标题中，带有human-computer interaction，但是这篇文章的主要内容其实还是在transparency，它并没有human-computer interaction的内容；这篇文章的内容非常好，讲到了transparency的精髓。

Any change in a [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) system, such as a new feature or new component, is **transparent** if the system after change adheres to previous [external interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)) as much as possible while changing its internal behaviour. The purpose is to shield(防止) from change all systems (or human users) on the other end of the interface. 

> NOTE: 这段的总结是非常好的

The term is used particularly often with regard to an [abstraction layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer) that is invisible either from its upper or lower neighbouring layer.

A transparency is some aspect of the distributed system that is hidden from the user (programmer, system developer, user or application program).
