# Priority inversion



## wikipedia [Priority inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **priority inversion** is a scenario in [scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)) in which a high priority [task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(computing)) is indirectly [preempted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)) by a lower priority task effectively inverting the relative priorities of the two tasks.
