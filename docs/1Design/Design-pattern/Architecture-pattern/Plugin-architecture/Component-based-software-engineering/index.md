**Component-based software engineering** (**CBSE**), also called **component-based development** (**CBD**), is a branch of software engineering that emphasizes the [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) with respect to the wide-ranging functionality available throughout a given [software system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system). It is a reuse-based approach to defining, implementing and composing loosely coupled independent components into systems. This practice aims to bring about an equally wide-ranging degree of benefits in both the short-term and the long-term for the software itself and for organizations that sponsor such software.

### Component models

A [component model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_model) is a definition of properties that components must satisfy, methods and mechanisms for the composition of components.

During the last decades, researchers and practitioners have proposed several component models with different characteristics. A classification of the existing component models is given in.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering#cite_note-crnkovic2011tse-6)[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering#cite_note-7) Examples of component models are: 

1、[Enterprise JavaBeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans) (EJB) model, 

2、[Component Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model) (COM) model, 

3、[.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) model, 

4、X-MAN component model,[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering#cite_note-8) and 

5、[Common Object Request Broker Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture) (CORBA) component model.
