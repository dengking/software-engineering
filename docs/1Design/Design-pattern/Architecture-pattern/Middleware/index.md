# Middleware

"middleware"即"中间件"。

## wikipedia [Middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware)

**Middleware** is a computer [software](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Software) that provides services to [software applications](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Software_application) beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as "software glue".[[1\]](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Middleware#cite_note-MW-00-1)

Middleware makes it easier for [software developers](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Software_developer) to implement communication and [input/output](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Input/output), so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application. It gained popularity in the 1980s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems, although the term had been in use since 1968.[[2\]](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Middleware#cite_note-2)
