# Information hiding



## wikipedia [Information hiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **information hiding** is the principle of segregation of the *design decisions* in a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that are most likely to change, thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive modification if the design decision is changed. The protection involves providing a stable [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computer_science)) which protects the remainder of the program from the implementation (the details that are most likely to change).

> NOTE: 通过提高abstract interface来实现information hiding

Written another way, information hiding is the ability to prevent certain aspects of a [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science)) or [software component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_component) from being accessible to its [clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)), using either programming language features (like private variables) or an explicit exporting policy.
