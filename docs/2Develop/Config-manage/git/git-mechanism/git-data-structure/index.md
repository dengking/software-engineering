> There’s lots more going on *inside* these repositories (branches, tags, and heads; or, blobs, trees, commits, and refs). In fact, during a merge, there’s more going on inside the *index*, too (“mine”, “ours”, and “theirs”). To a first approximation, all that’s orthogonal to how data gets *between* data stores; we’ll ignore it.
