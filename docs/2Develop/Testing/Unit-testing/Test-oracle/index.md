# Test oracle

## wikipedia [Test oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_oracle)

In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), and [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing), a **test oracle** (or just **oracle**) is a mechanism for determining whether a test has passed or failed.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_oracle#cite_note-1) The use of oracles involves comparing the output(s) of the system under test, for a given [test-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case) input, to the output(s) that the oracle determines that product should have.
