是在阅读 github [google](https://github.com/google)/**[googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)** 时，其中提及了TAP protocol。

## wikipedia [Test Anything Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol)

The **Test Anything Protocol** (**TAP**) is a protocol to allow communication between [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_test) and a [test harness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_harness). It allows individual tests (TAP producers) to communicate test results to the testing harness in a [language-agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-independent_specification) way. Originally developed for unit testing of the [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) interpreter in 1987, **producers** and **parsers** are now available for many development platforms.

TAP, the Test Anything Protocol, is a simple text-based interface between testing modules in a test harness. TAP started life as part of the test harness for Perl but now has implementations in C, C++, Python, PHP, Perl, Java, JavaScript, and others.
