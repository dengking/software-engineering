**Software engineering** is the systematic application of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) approaches to the [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development) of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software). Software engineering is a direct sub-field of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) and has an overlap with [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [management science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_science).

## Fields

### [Software requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements)



### [Software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design)



[Software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)



### [Software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development)

[Software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development), the main activity of [software construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_construction): is the combination of [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) (aka coding), verification, [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing), and [debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging). A [Software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process): is the definition, implementation, assessment, measurement, management, change, and improvement of the software life cycle process itself. It heavily uses [Software configuration management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management) which is about systematically controlling changes to the configuration, and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration and code throughout the system life cycle. Modern processes use [software versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning).
