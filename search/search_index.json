This document synthesizes(\u7efc\u5408) all of our experience and observations on a wide variety of software-as-a-service apps in the wild. It is a triangulation(\u4e09\u89d2) on ideal practices (\u7406\u60f3\u5b9e\u8df5) for app development, paying particular attention to the dynamics of the organic growth of an app over time(\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u673a\u589e\u957f\u52a8\u6001), the dynamics of collaboration between developers working on the app\u2019s codebase(\u5f00\u53d1\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u907f\u514d\u6210\u672c \u8f6f\u4ef6\u4fb5\u8680), and avoiding the cost of software erosion .

Any developer building applications which run as a service. Ops engineers who deploy or manage such applications. The Twelve Factors I. Codebase One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys \u4f7f\u7528\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684codebase\u3002 \u603b\u7ed3\uff1a\u8fd9\u6bb5\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e09\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1aapp\uff0ccode repo\uff0cdeploy\uff0ccodebase A twelve-factor app is always tracked in a version control system , such as Git , Mercurial , or Subversion . A copy of the revision tracking database is known as a code repository , often shortened to code repo or just repo . A codebase is any single repo (in a centralized revision control system like Subversion)(\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u662f\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93), or any set of repos who share a root commit (in a decentralized revision control system like Git). There is always a one-to-one correlation between the codebase and the app(\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u7684\u5173\u8054): If there are multiple codebases, it\u2019s not an app \u2013 it\u2019s a distributed system(\u5982\u679c\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f - \u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf). Each component in a distributed system is an app, and each can individually comply with twelve-factor. Multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of twelve-factor. The solution here is to factor(\u5206\u89e3) shared code into libraries which can be included through the dependency manager . There is only one codebase per app, but there will be many deploys of the app(\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5c06\u5f88\u591a). A deploy is a running instance of the app. This is typically a production site, and one or more staging sites(\u4e34\u65f6\u7ad9\u70b9). Additionally, every developer has a copy of the app running in their local development environment, each of which also qualifies as a deploy . The codebase is the same across all deploys, although different versions may be active in each deploy. For example, a developer has some commits not yet deployed to staging; staging has some commits not yet deployed to production. But they all share the same codebase, thus making them identifiable as different deploys of the same app. II. Dependencies Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies III. Config Store config in the environment IV. Backing services Treat backing services as attached resources V. Build, release, run Strictly separate build and run stages VI. Processes Execute the app as one or more stateless processes VII. Port binding Export services via port binding VIII. Concurrency Scale out via the process model IX. Disposability Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown X. Dev/prod parity Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible XI. Logs Treat logs as event streams XII. Admin processes Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes","title":"12factor"},{"location":"Experience/12factor/#12factor","text":"","title":"12factor"},{"location":"Experience/12factor/#introduction","text":"In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps , or software-as-a-service .

There is always a one-to-one correlation between the codebase and the app(\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u7684\u5173\u8054): If there are multiple codebases, it\u2019s not an app \u2013 it\u2019s a distributed system(\u5982\u679c\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f - \u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf). Each component in a distributed system is an app, and each can individually comply with twelve-factor. Multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of twelve-factor. The solution here is to factor(\u5206\u89e3) shared code into libraries which can be included through the dependency manager . There is only one codebase per app, but there will be many deploys of the app(\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5c06\u5f88\u591a). A deploy is a running instance of the app. This is typically a production site, and one or more staging sites(\u4e34\u65f6\u7ad9\u70b9). Additionally, every developer has a copy of the app running in their local development environment, each of which also qualifies as a deploy . The codebase is the same across all deploys, although different versions may be active in each deploy. For example, a developer has some commits not yet deployed to staging; staging has some commits not yet deployed to production. But they all share the same codebase, thus making them identifiable as different deploys of the same app.","title":"One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys"},{"location":"Experience/12factor/#ii#dependencies","text":"","title":"II.

CPU-bound wikipedia I/O bound In computer science , I/O bound refers to a condition in which the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound . This circumstance arises when the rate at which data is requested is slower than the rate it is consumed or, in other words, more time is spent requesting data than processing it.[ 1] I/O bound as an inherent problem in computing NOTE: I/O\u74f6\u9888\u662f\u5f53\u4ee3computing\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fa\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece Von Neumann architecture \u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u4eceIO bound\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u4e86 Von Neumann bottleneck \u3002\u8fd9\u63d0\u793a\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86...\u3002 The I/O bound state has been identified as a problem in computing almost since its inception. The Von Neumann architecture , which is employed by many computing devices, this involves multiple possible solutions such as implementing a logically separate central processor unit which along with storing the instructions of the program also retrieves actual data usually from main memory and makes use of this much easily accessible data for working. When the process is terminated it writes back the results to the original storage (usually the main memory ). Since data must be moved between the CPU and memory along a bus which has a limited data transfer rate , there exists a condition that is known as the Von Neumann bottleneck . Put simply, this means that the data bandwidth between the CPU and memory tends to limit the overall speed of computation. In terms of the actual technology that makes up a computer, the Von Neumann Bottleneck predicts that it is easier to make the CPU perform calculations faster than it is to supply it with data at the necessary rate for this to be possible. In recent history, the Von Neumann bottleneck has become more apparent. The design philosophy of modern computers is based upon a physically separate CPU and main memory. It is possible to make the CPU run at a high data transfer rate because data is moved between locations inside them across tiny distances. The physical separation between CPU and main memory, however, requires a data bus to move data across comparatively long distances of centimetres or more. The problem of making this part of the system operate sufficiently fast to keep up with the CPU has been a great challenge to designers.[ 2] NOTE: \u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u660e\u663e\u4e86 CPU bound vs IO bound yaoyao CPU bound vs IO bound From stackoverflow: What do the terms \u201cCPU bound\u201d and \u201cI/O bound\u201d mean? : 1) CPU Bound means the rate at which process progresses is limited by the speed of the CPU . A task that performs calculations on a small set of numbers, for example multiplying small matrices, is likely to be CPU bound. A program is CPU bound if it would go faster if the CPU were faster. 2) I/O Bound means the rate at which a process progresses is limited by the speed of the I/O subsystem. A task that processes data from disk, for example, counting the number of lines in a file is likely to be I/O bound. A program is I/O bound if it would go faster if the I/O subsystem was faster. stackoverflow What do the terms \u201cCPU bound\u201d and \u201cI/O bound\u201d mean? What do the terms \"CPU bound\" and \"I/O bound\" mean? A It's pretty intuitive: A program is CPU bound if it would go faster if the CPU were faster, i.e. it spends the majority of its time simply using the CPU (doing calculations). A program that computes new digits of \u03c0 will typically be CPU-bound, it's just crunching numbers. A program is I/O bound if it would go faster if the I/O subsystem was faster. Which exact I/O system is meant can vary; I typically associate it with disk , but of course networking or communication in general is common too. A program that looks through a huge file for some data might become I/O bound, since the bottleneck is then the reading of the data from disk (actually, this example is perhaps kind of old-fashioned these days with hundreds of MB/s coming in from SSDs).

So it saves the expensive context change in the wait state but it fully utilises the CPU:","title":"TODO: Why system call slow?"},{"location":"Software-design/","text":"\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u5de5\u7a0b \u672c\u5de5\u7a0b\u8ba8\u8bba\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u5bbd\u6cdb\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u975e\u5e38\u591a\u3002 wikipedia Software design \u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c42\u6b21 \u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u5bbd\u6cdb\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u6574\u4f53\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u4ece\u9876\u5c42\u5230\u5e95\u5c42\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5404\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u5b83\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u5173\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5728 Design-pattern\\index.md \u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u603b\u7ed3\u3002 \u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9 \u672c\u8282\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5982\u4e0b: \u7ae0\u8282 \u8bf4\u660e Principle \u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3001\u601d\u8def Design-pattern \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9\u5148\u9a71\u4eec\u6240\u603b\u7ed3\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60 Tools \u63cf\u8ff0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5de5\u5177 \u501f\u9274\u6210\u529f\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u67b6\u6784 Redis SQLite clang","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Software-design/#_1","text":"\u672c\u5de5\u7a0b\u8ba8\u8bba\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u5bbd\u6cdb\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u975e\u5e38\u591a\u3002","title":"\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u5de5\u7a0b"},{"location":"Software-design/#wikipedia#software#design","text":"","title":"wikipedia Software design"},{"location":"Software-design/#_2","text":"\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u5bbd\u6cdb\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u6574\u4f53\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u4ece\u9876\u5c42\u5230\u5e95\u5c42\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5404\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u5b83\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u5173\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5728 Design-pattern\\index.md \u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u603b\u7ed3\u3002","title":"\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c42\u6b21"},{"location":"Software-design/#_3","text":"\u672c\u8282\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\u5982\u4e0b: \u7ae0\u8282 \u8bf4\u660e Principle \u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3001\u601d\u8def Design-pattern \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9\u5148\u9a71\u4eec\u6240\u603b\u7ed3\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60 Tools \u63cf\u8ff0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5de5\u5177","title":"\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9"},{"location":"Software-design/#_4","text":"Redis SQLite clang","title":"\u501f\u9274\u6210\u529f\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u67b6\u6784"},{"location":"Software-design/Experience/","text":"\u8bbe\u8ba1 \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684interface\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982python\uff0credis\u7b49\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u90fd\u6709\u7740\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684interface\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a command line interface api configuration \u65e0\u8bba\u662fcpython\u8fd8\u662fredis\uff0c\u90fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684interface\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u3002","title":"Experience"},{"location":"Software-design/Experience/#_1","text":"\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684interface\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982python\uff0credis\u7b49\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u90fd\u6709\u7740\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684interface\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a command line interface api configuration \u65e0\u8bba\u662fcpython\u8fd8\u662fredis\uff0c\u90fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684interface\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u3002","title":"\u8bbe\u8ba1"},{"location":"Software-design/Commonality-and-variability-analysis/","text":"Commonality-variability analysis \"commonality variability analysis\"\u662f\u6211\u5728\u9605\u8bfbwikipedia Modern C++ Design # Policy-based design \u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684: The main idea is to use commonality-variability analysis to divide the type into the fixed implementation and interface, the policy-based class, and the different policies.

It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code . It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. NOTE: design pattern\u662fformalized best practices Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects , without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable\uff08\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\uff09 state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages. NOTE: \u5173\u4e8efunctional programming\uff0c\u53c2\u89c1 Theory\\Programming-paradigm\\Functional-programming \u7ae0\u8282\u3002 Practice Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Freshly written code can often have hidden subtle issues that take time to be detected, issues that sometimes can cause major problems down the road. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent such subtle issues , and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

Since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components , researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted. Software design techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem.

I like the analogy to road construction: you can make an intersection\uff08\u5341\u5b57\u8def\u53e3\uff09 safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians\uff08\u884c\u4eba\uff09.

model ) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols . The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers . The original version of the model had seven layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. \u4e0a\u9762\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u5176\u5b9e\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86**\u5206\u5c42**\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff1ainteroperability \uff0c\u5404\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e92\u76f8\u900f\u660e\uff08\u9690\u85cf\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6280\u672f\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u5b9a\u597d\u7684 communication protocols \u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002 OSI model by layer layer 7 Application layer 6 Presentation layer 5 Session layer 4 Transport layer 3 Network layer 2 Data link layer 1 Physical layer Internet protocol suite Database abstraction layer \u8fd9\u6bb5\u63cf\u8ff0\u975e\u5e38\u597d\uff1a A database abstraction layer ( DBAL or DAL ) is an application programming interface which unifies the communication between a computer application and databases such as SQL Server , DB2 , MySQL , PostgreSQL , Oracle or SQLite . \u4ee5\u5c42\u6b21\u601d\u60f3\u6765\u601d\u8003 \u95ee\u9898\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u54ea\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21 \u5728\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u51fa\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff0c\u5c31\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8003\u8651\u3002 \u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u76f8\u4e92\u501f\u7528\u6982\u5ff5 \u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u7ad9\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u6765\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u4e4b\u95f4\u4f1a\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u6982\u5ff5\u501f\u7528\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u6765\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\uff1a \u6848\u4f8b \u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u63cf\u8ff0\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u975e\u5e38\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u6709\u7740\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u5728 Linux-OS-kernel-is-event-driven \u4e2d\u603b\u7ed3\u7684\uff1a Hardware Software Interrupt-driven Event-driven architecture / Event-driven programming Interrupt Event (computing) Interrupt handler / Interrupt service routine Event handler / Callback function \u5404\u79cdinterrupt\u5c31\u662f\u6240\u8c13\u7684event\u3002 \u6848\u4f8b linux\u7684 epoll \u7684 triggering mode \u501f\u7528\u4e86 Interrupt \u7684 triggering methods \u6982\u5ff5\u3002 \u6848\u4f8b \u5728 Understanding.The.Linux.kernel.3 rd .Edition \u7684Chapter 4.

In computer science , a pool is a collection of resources that are kept[ clarification needed ] ready to use, rather than acquired on use and released[ clarification needed ] afterwards. In this context, resources can refer to 1) system resources such as file handles , which are external to a process, or 2) internal resources such as objects . A pool client requests a resource from the pool and performs desired operations on the returned resource. When the client finishes its use of the resource, it is returned to the pool rather than released and lost.[ clarification needed ] The pooling of resources can offer a significant response-time boost in situations that have high cost associated with resource acquiring, high rate of the requests for resources, and a low overall count of simultaneously used resources. Pooling is also useful when the latency is a concern, because a pool offers predictable times required to obtain resources since they have already been acquired. These benefits are mostly true for system resources that require a system call , or remote resources that require a network communication, such as database connections , socket connections , threads , and memory allocation . Pooling is also useful for expensive-to-compute data, notably large graphic objects like fonts or bitmaps , acting essentially as a data cache or a memoization technique. NOTE: optimization\u3001performance Special cases of pools are connection pools , thread pools , and memory pools . Object pools Main article: Object pool pattern Pools can also be used for objects, in which context a pool refers to a design pattern for implementing pools in object-oriented languages , such as in the object pool pattern . Objects themselves hold no external resources and only occupy memory, although an already created object avoids the memory allocation required on object creation. Object pools are useful when the cost of object creation is high, but in certain situations this simple object pooling may not be efficient and could in fact decrease performance.[ 1] Connection pool wikipedia connection pools Implementation redis-plus-plus redis Guidelines for Redis clients with support for Redis Sentinel hiredispool Memory pool wikipedia Memory pool wikipedia Slab allocation Implementation stackoverflow What are the usual im\u00adple\u00admen\u00adta\u00adtion de\u00adtails be\u00adhind mem\u00adory pools? cacay/Memory*Pool* \u8f83\u597d Boost.Pool https://www.boost.org/ https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/ Pool Memory pool management. theboostcpplibraries Chapter 4.

These are often referred to as lightweight containers, examples include PicoContainer , and Spring . Underlying these containers are a number of interesting design principles , things that go beyond both these specific containers and indeed the Java platform. Here I want to start exploring some of these principles. The examples I use are in Java, but like most of my writing the principles are equally applicable to other OO environments, particularly .NET. NOTE: \u4f5c\u8005\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u7684\u610f\u601d\u662f\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e9bcontainer\u3001Java platform\u6240\u91c7\u7528\u7684**design principles**\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u540c\u6837\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6 \u7684OO environment\u3002 Components and Services I use component to mean a glob of software that's intended to be used, without change, by an application that is out of the control of the writers of the component. By 'without change' I mean that the using application doesn't change the source code of the components, although they may alter the component's behavior by extending it in ways allowed by the component writers. A service is similar to a component in that it's used by foreign applications. The main difference is that I expect a component to be used locally (think jar file, assembly, dll, or a source import). A service will be used remotely through some remote interface, either synchronous or asynchronous (eg web service, messaging system, RPC, or socket.) I mostly use service in this article, but much of the same logic can be applied to local components too. Indeed often you need some kind of local component framework to easily access a remote service . But writing \"component or service\" is tiring to read and write, and services are much more fashionable at the moment. A Naive Example In this example I'm writing a component that provides a list of movies directed by a particular director. This stunningly useful function is implemented by a single method. class MovieLister ... public Movie [] moviesDirectedBy ( String arg ) { List allMovies = finder . findAll (); for ( Iterator it = allMovies . iterator (); it . hasNext ();) { Movie movie = ( Movie ) it . next (); if ( ! movie . getDirector (). equals ( arg )) it . remove (); } return ( Movie [] ) allMovies . toArray ( new Movie [ allMovies . size () ] ); } The implementation of this function is naive in the extreme, it asks a finder object (which we'll get to in a moment) to return every film it knows about. Then it just hunts through this list to return those directed by a particular director. This particular piece of naivety I'm not going to fix, since it's just the scaffolding\uff08\u811a\u624b\u67b6\uff09 for the real point of this article. The real point of this article is this finder object , or particularly how we connect the lister object with a particular finder object . The reason why this is interesting is that I want my wonderful moviesDirectedBy method to be completely independent of how all the movies are being stored. So all the method does is refer to a finder , and all that finder does is know how to respond to the findAll method. I can bring this out by defining an interface for the finder . public interface MovieFinder { List findAll (); } Now all of this is very well decoupled, but at some point I have to come up with a concrete class to actually come up with the movies. In this case I put the code for this in the constructor of my lister class. class MovieLister ... private MovieFinder finder ; public MovieLister () { finder = new ColonDelimitedMovieFinder ( \"movies1.txt\" ); } The name of the implementation class comes from the fact that I'm getting my list from a colon\uff08\u5192\u53f7\uff09 delimited text file. I'll spare you the details, after all the point is just that there's some implementation. Now if I'm using this class for just myself, this is all fine and dandy\uff08\u6781\u597d\u7684\uff09. But what happens when my friends are overwhelmed\uff08\u88ab\u6253\u5012\uff09 by a desire for this wonderful functionality and would like a copy of my program? If they also store their movie listings in a colon delimited text file called \"movies1.txt\" then everything is wonderful. If they have a different name for their movies file, then it's easy to put the name of the file in a properties file. But what if they have a completely different form of storing their movie listing: a SQL database, an XML file, a web service, or just another format of text file? In this case we need a different class to grab that data. Now because I've defined a MovieFinder interface, this won't alter my moviesDirectedBy method. But I still need to have some way to get an instance of the right finder implementation into place. Figure 1: The dependencies using a simple creation in the lister class Figure 1 shows the dependencies for this situation. The MovieLister class is dependent on both the MovieFinder interface and upon the implementation. We would prefer it if it were only dependent on the interface, but then how do we make an instance to work with? plugin In my book P of EAA , we described this situation as a Plugin . The implementation class for the finder isn't linked into the program at compile time, since I don't know what my friends are going to use. Instead we want my lister to work with any implementation, and for that implementation to be plugged in at some later point, out of my hands. The problem is how can I make that link so that my lister class is ignorant of the implementation class, but can still talk to an instance to do its work. Expanding this into a real system, we might have dozens of such services and components. In each case we can abstract our use of these components by talking to them through an interface (and using an adapter if the component isn't designed with an interface in mind). But if we wish to deploy this system in different ways, we need to use plugins to handle the interaction with these services so we can use different implementations in different deployments. So the core problem is how do we assemble these plugins into an application? This is one of the main problems that this new breed of lightweight containers face, and universally they all do it using Inversion of Control . Inversion of Control The question is: \"what aspect of control are they inverting?\" When I first ran into inversion of control , it was in the main control of a user interface. Early user interfaces were controlled by the application program. You would have a sequence of commands like \"Enter name\", \"enter address\"; your program would drive the prompts and pick up a response to each one. With graphical (or even screen based) UIs the UI framework would contain this main loop and your program instead provided event handlers for the various fields on the screen. The main control of the program was inverted, moved away from you to the framework . NOTE: \u5728UI framework\u4e2d\uff0c\u88abinvert\u7684control\u662fmain control\u3002\u5728\u666e\u901a\u7684application program\u4e2d\uff0cmain control\u662f\u7531application program\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5728UI framework\u4e2d\uff0cmain control\u7531UI framework\u63a7\u5236\u3002 For this new breed of containers the inversion is about how they lookup a plugin implementation . In my naive example the lister looked up the finder implementation by directly instantiating it. This stops the finder from being a plugin. The approach that these containers use is to ensure that any user of a plugin follows some convention that allows a separate assembler module to inject the implementation into the lister . As a result I think we need a more specific name for this pattern. Inversion of Control is too generic a term, and thus people find it confusing. As a result with a lot of discussion with various IoC advocates we settled on the name Dependency Injection .

The other pattern you can use to do this is Service Locator , and I'll discuss that after I'm done with explaining Dependency Injection . Forms of Dependency Injection The basic idea of the Dependency Injection is to have a separate object, an assembler, that populates a field in the lister class with an appropriate implementation for the finder interface, resulting in a dependency diagram along the lines of Figure 2 Figure 2: The dependencies for a Dependency Injector There are three main styles of dependency injection . The names I'm using for them are Constructor Injection , Setter Injection , and Interface Injection . If you read about this stuff in the current discussions about Inversion of Control you'll hear these referred to as type 1 IoC (interface injection), type 2 IoC (setter injection) and type 3 IoC (constructor injection). I find numeric names rather hard to remember, which is why I've used the names I have here. Constructor Injection with PicoContainer Setter Injection with Spring The Spring framework is a wide ranging framework for enterprise Java development. It includes abstraction layers for transactions, persistence frameworks, web application development and JDBC. Like PicoContainer it supports both constructor and setter injection, but its developers tend to prefer setter injection - which makes it an appropriate choice for this example.

These are often referred to as lightweight containers, examples include PicoContainer , and Spring . Underlying these containers are a number of interesting design principles , things that go beyond both these specific containers and indeed the Java platform. Here I want to start exploring some of these principles. The examples I use are in Java, but like most of my writing the principles are equally applicable to other OO environments, particularly .NET.

By 'without change' I mean that the using application doesn't change the source code of the components, although they may alter the component's behavior by extending it in ways allowed by the component writers. A service is similar to a component in that it's used by foreign applications. The main difference is that I expect a component to be used locally (think jar file, assembly, dll, or a source import). A service will be used remotely through some remote interface, either synchronous or asynchronous (eg web service, messaging system, RPC, or socket.) I mostly use service in this article, but much of the same logic can be applied to local components too. Indeed often you need some kind of local component framework to easily access a remote service . But writing \"component or service\" is tiring to read and write, and services are much more fashionable at the moment.","title":"Components and Services"},{"location":"Software-design/Principle/Control-theory/Inversion-of-control/#a#naive#example","text":"In this example I'm writing a component that provides a list of movies directed by a particular director. This stunningly useful function is implemented by a single method. class MovieLister ... public Movie [] moviesDirectedBy ( String arg ) { List allMovies = finder . findAll (); for ( Iterator it = allMovies . iterator (); it . hasNext ();) { Movie movie = ( Movie ) it . next (); if ( ! movie . getDirector (). equals ( arg )) it . remove (); } return ( Movie [] ) allMovies . toArray ( new Movie [ allMovies . size () ] ); } The implementation of this function is naive in the extreme, it asks a finder object (which we'll get to in a moment) to return every film it knows about. Then it just hunts through this list to return those directed by a particular director. This particular piece of naivety I'm not going to fix, since it's just the scaffolding\uff08\u811a\u624b\u67b6\uff09 for the real point of this article. The real point of this article is this finder object , or particularly how we connect the lister object with a particular finder object . The reason why this is interesting is that I want my wonderful moviesDirectedBy method to be completely independent of how all the movies are being stored. So all the method does is refer to a finder , and all that finder does is know how to respond to the findAll method. I can bring this out by defining an interface for the finder . public interface MovieFinder { List findAll (); } Now all of this is very well decoupled, but at some point I have to come up with a concrete class to actually come up with the movies. In this case I put the code for this in the constructor of my lister class. class MovieLister ... private MovieFinder finder ; public MovieLister () { finder = new ColonDelimitedMovieFinder ( \"movies1.txt\" ); } The name of the implementation class comes from the fact that I'm getting my list from a colon\uff08\u5192\u53f7\uff09 delimited text file. I'll spare you the details, after all the point is just that there's some implementation. Now if I'm using this class for just myself, this is all fine and dandy\uff08\u6781\u597d\u7684\uff09. But what happens when my friends are overwhelmed\uff08\u88ab\u6253\u5012\uff09 by a desire for this wonderful functionality and would like a copy of my program? If they also store their movie listings in a colon delimited text file called \"movies1.txt\" then everything is wonderful. If they have a different name for their movies file, then it's easy to put the name of the file in a properties file. But what if they have a completely different form of storing their movie listing: a SQL database, an XML file, a web service, or just another format of text file? In this case we need a different class to grab that data. Now because I've defined a MovieFinder interface, this won't alter my moviesDirectedBy method. But I still need to have some way to get an instance of the right finder implementation into place. Figure 1: The dependencies using a simple creation in the lister class Figure 1 shows the dependencies for this situation. The MovieLister class is dependent on both the MovieFinder interface and upon the implementation. We would prefer it if it were only dependent on the interface, but then how do we make an instance to work with?","title":"A Naive Example"},{"location":"Software-design/Principle/Control-theory/Inversion-of-control/#plugin","text":"In my book P of EAA , we described this situation as a Plugin . The implementation class for the finder isn't linked into the program at compile time, since I don't know what my friends are going to use. Instead we want my lister to work with any implementation, and for that implementation to be plugged in at some later point, out of my hands. The problem is how can I make that link so that my lister class is ignorant of the implementation class, but can still talk to an instance to do its work. Expanding this into a real system, we might have dozens of such services and components. In each case we can abstract our use of these components by talking to them through an interface (and using an adapter if the component isn't designed with an interface in mind). But if we wish to deploy this system in different ways, we need to use plugins to handle the interaction with these services so we can use different implementations in different deployments. So the core problem is how do we assemble these plugins into an application? This is one of the main problems that this new breed of lightweight containers face, and universally they all do it using Inversion of Control .","title":"plugin"},{"location":"Software-design/Principle/Control-theory/Inversion-of-control/#inversion#of#control_1","text":"The question is: \"what aspect of control are they inverting?\" When I first ran into inversion of control , it was in the main control of a user interface. Early user interfaces were controlled by the application program. You would have a sequence of commands like \"Enter name\", \"enter address\"; your program would drive the prompts and pick up a response to each one. With graphical (or even screen based) UIs the UI framework would contain this main loop and your program instead provided event handlers for the various fields on the screen. The main control of the program was inverted, moved away from you to the framework .

In my naive example the lister looked up the finder implementation by directly instantiating it. This stops the finder from being a plugin. The approach that these containers use is to ensure that any user of a plugin follows some convention that allows a separate assembler module to inject the implementation into the lister . As a result I think we need a more specific name for this pattern. Inversion of Control is too generic a term, and thus people find it confusing. As a result with a lot of discussion with various IoC advocates we settled on the name Dependency Injection .

This include control over the flow of an application, and control over the flow of an object creation or dependent object creation and binding.

First of all, let's understand what we mean by dependency here. public class A { B b ; public A () { b = new B (); } public void Task1 () { // do something here.. b . SomeMethod (); // do something here.. } } public class B { public void SomeMethod () { //doing something.. } } In the above example, class A calls b.SomeMethod() to complete its task1 . Class A cannot complete its task without class B and so you can say that \"Class A is dependent on class B\" or \"class B is a dependency of class A\". In the object-oriented design approach, classes need to interact with each other in order to complete one or more functionalities of an application, such as in the above example - classes A and B . Class A creates and manages the life time of an object of class B . Essentially, it controls the creation and life time of objects of the dependency class. The IoC principle suggests to invert the control. This means to delegate the control to another class. In other words, invert the dependency creation control from class A to another class, as shown below.

GetObjectOfB (); } public void Task1 () { // do something here.. b . SomeMethod (); // do something here.. } } public class Factory { public static B GetObjectOfB () { return new B (); } } As you can see above, class A uses Factory class to get an object of class B . Thus, we have inverted the dependent object creation from class A to Factory. Class A no longer creates an object of class B , instead it uses the factory class to get the object of class B . Let's understand this using a more practical example. In an object-oriented design, classes should be designed in a loosely coupled way. Loosely coupled means changes in one class should not force other classes to change, so the whole application can become maintainable and extensible . Let's understand this by using typical n-tier architecture as depicted by the following figure: In the typical n-tier architecture, the User Interface (UI) uses Service layer to retrieve or save data. The Service layer uses the BusinessLogic class to apply business rules on the data. The BusinessLogic class depends on the DataAccess class which retrieves or saves the data to the underlying database. This is simple n-tier architecture design. Let's focus on the BusinessLogic and DataAccess classes to understand IoC. The following is an example of BusinessLogic and DataAccess classes for a customer. public class CustomerBusinessLogic { DataAccess _dataAccess ; public CustomerBusinessLogic () { _dataAccess = new DataAccess (); } public string GetCustomerName ( int id ) { return _dataAccess . GetCustomerName ( id ); } } public class DataAccess { public DataAccess () { } public string GetCustomerName ( int id ) { return \"Dummy Customer Name\" ; // get it from DB in real app } } As you can see in the above example, the CustomerBusinessLogic class depends on the DataAccess class. It creates an object of the DataAccess class to get the customer data. Now, let's understand what's wrong with the above classes. In the above example, CustomerBusinessLogic and DataAccess are tightly coupled classes because the CustomerBusinessLogic class includes the reference of the concrete DataAccess class. It also creates an object of DataAccess class and manages the lifetime of the object. Problems in the above example classes: CustomerBusinessLogic and DataAccess classes are tightly coupled classes. So, changes in the DataAccess class will lead to changes in the CustomerBusinessLogic class. For example, if we add, remove or rename any method in the DataAccess class then we need to change the CustomerBusinessLogic class accordingly. Suppose the customer data comes from different databases or web services and, in the future, we may need to create different classes, so this will lead to changes in the CustomerBusinessLogic class. The CustomerBusinessLogic class creates an object of the DataAccess class using the new keyword. There may be multiple classes which use the DataAccess class and create its objects. So, if you change the name of the class, then you need to find all the places in your source code where you created objects of DataAccess and make the changes throughout the code. This is repetitive code for creating objects of the same class and maintaining their dependencies. Because the CustomerBusinessLogic class creates an object of the concrete DataAccess class, it cannot be tested independently (TDD). The DataAccess class cannot be replaced with a mock class.

Remember, IoC is a principle, not a pattern. It just gives high-level design guidelines but does not give implementation details. You are free to implement the IoC principle the way you want. The following pattern (but not limited) implements the IoC principle. Let's use the Factory pattern to implement IoC in the above example, as the first step towards attaining loosely coupled classes. public class DataAccessFactory { public static DataAccess GetDataAccessObj () { return new DataAccess (); } } Dependency Inversion Principle NOTE: \u672c\u8282\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u8282\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u201cImplement DIP by creating abstraction\u201d First, let's understand what is Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)?

As the name suggests, it is used to invert different kinds of controls in object-oriented design to achieve loose coupling. Here, controls refer to any additional responsibilities a class has, other than its main responsibility. This include control over the flow of an application, and control over the flow of an object creation or dependent object creation and binding.

First of all, let's understand what we mean by dependency here. public class A { B b ; public A () { b = new B (); } public void Task1 () { // do something here.. b . SomeMethod (); // do something here.. } } public class B { public void SomeMethod () { //doing something.. } } In the above example, class A calls b.SomeMethod() to complete its task1 . Class A cannot complete its task without class B and so you can say that \"Class A is dependent on class B\" or \"class B is a dependency of class A\". In the object-oriented design approach, classes need to interact with each other in order to complete one or more functionalities of an application, such as in the above example - classes A and B . Class A creates and manages the life time of an object of class B . Essentially, it controls the creation and life time of objects of the dependency class. The IoC principle suggests to invert the control. This means to delegate the control to another class. In other words, invert the dependency creation control from class A to another class, as shown below. NOTE: \u7531\u53e6\u5916\u7684\u4e00\u4e2aclass\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0control\uff0c\u8fd9\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u5c42indirection\uff0c\u6700\u6700\u5178\u578b\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u5c31\u662ffactory class\u3001framework\u3001container \u3002 public class A { B b ; public A () { b = Factory . GetObjectOfB (); } public void Task1 () { // do something here.. b . SomeMethod (); // do something here.. } } public class Factory { public static B GetObjectOfB () { return new B (); } } As you can see above, class A uses Factory class to get an object of class B . Thus, we have inverted the dependent object creation from class A to Factory. Class A no longer creates an object of class B , instead it uses the factory class to get the object of class B . Let's understand this using a more practical example. In an object-oriented design, classes should be designed in a loosely coupled way. Loosely coupled means changes in one class should not force other classes to change, so the whole application can become maintainable and extensible . Let's understand this by using typical n-tier architecture as depicted by the following figure: In the typical n-tier architecture, the User Interface (UI) uses Service layer to retrieve or save data. The Service layer uses the BusinessLogic class to apply business rules on the data. The BusinessLogic class depends on the DataAccess class which retrieves or saves the data to the underlying database. This is simple n-tier architecture design. Let's focus on the BusinessLogic and DataAccess classes to understand IoC. The following is an example of BusinessLogic and DataAccess classes for a customer. public class CustomerBusinessLogic { DataAccess _dataAccess ; public CustomerBusinessLogic () { _dataAccess = new DataAccess (); } public string GetCustomerName ( int id ) { return _dataAccess . GetCustomerName ( id ); } } public class DataAccess { public DataAccess () { } public string GetCustomerName ( int id ) { return \"Dummy Customer Name\" ; // get it from DB in real app } } As you can see in the above example, the CustomerBusinessLogic class depends on the DataAccess class. It creates an object of the DataAccess class to get the customer data. Now, let's understand what's wrong with the above classes. In the above example, CustomerBusinessLogic and DataAccess are tightly coupled classes because the CustomerBusinessLogic class includes the reference of the concrete DataAccess class. It also creates an object of DataAccess class and manages the lifetime of the object. Problems in the above example classes: CustomerBusinessLogic and DataAccess classes are tightly coupled classes. So, changes in the DataAccess class will lead to changes in the CustomerBusinessLogic class. For example, if we add, remove or rename any method in the DataAccess class then we need to change the CustomerBusinessLogic class accordingly. Suppose the customer data comes from different databases or web services and, in the future, we may need to create different classes, so this will lead to changes in the CustomerBusinessLogic class. The CustomerBusinessLogic class creates an object of the DataAccess class using the new keyword. There may be multiple classes which use the DataAccess class and create its objects. So, if you change the name of the class, then you need to find all the places in your source code where you created objects of DataAccess and make the changes throughout the code. This is repetitive code for creating objects of the same class and maintaining their dependencies. Because the CustomerBusinessLogic class creates an object of the concrete DataAccess class, it cannot be tested independently (TDD). The DataAccess class cannot be replaced with a mock class.

Remember, IoC is a principle, not a pattern. It just gives high-level design guidelines but does not give implementation details. You are free to implement the IoC principle the way you want. The following pattern (but not limited) implements the IoC principle. Let's use the Factory pattern to implement IoC in the above example, as the first step towards attaining loosely coupled classes. public class DataAccessFactory { public static DataAccess GetDataAccessObj () { return new DataAccess (); } }","title":"Control Over the Dependent Object Creation"},{"location":"Software-design/Principle/Control-theory/Inversion-of-control/tutorialsteacher-Inversion-of-Control/#dependency#inversion#principle","text":"NOTE: \u672c\u8282\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u8282\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u201cImplement DIP by creating abstraction\u201d First, let's understand what is Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)?

The term was used by Michael Mattsson in a thesis[ 2] , taken from there[ 3] by Stefano Mazzocchi and popularized by him in 1999 in a defunct Apache Software Foundation project, Avalon , then further popularized in 2004 by Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler . The term is related to, but different from, the dependency inversion principle , which concerns itself with decoupling dependencies between high-level and low-level layers through shared abstractions . The general concept is also related to event-driven programming in that it is often implemented using IoC, so that the custom code is commonly only concerned with the handling of events, whereas the event loop and dispatch of events/messages is handled by the framework or the runtime environment. Overview As an example, with traditional programming, the main function of an application might make function calls into a menu library to display a list of available commands and query the user to select one.[ 4] The library thus would return the chosen option as the value of the function call, and the main function uses this value to execute the associated command. This style was common in text based interfaces . For example, an email client may show a screen with commands to load new mails, answer the current mail, start a new mail, etc., and the program execution would block until the user presses a key to select a command. With inversion of control , on the other hand, the program would be written using a software framework that knows common behavioral and graphical elements, such as windowing systems , menus, controlling the mouse, and so on. The custom code \"fills in the blanks\" for the framework , such as supplying a table of menu items and registering a code subroutine for each item, but it is the framework that monitors the user's actions and invokes the subroutine when a menu item is selected. In the mail client example, the framework could follow both the keyboard and mouse inputs and call the command invoked by the user by either means, and at the same time monitor the network interface to find out if new messages arrive and refresh the screen when some network activity is detected. The same framework could be used as the skeleton(\u6846\u67b6) for a spreadsheet program or a text editor. Conversely, the framework knows nothing about Web browsers, spreadsheets or text editors; implementing their functionality takes custom code.

Software frameworks , callbacks , schedulers , event loops , dependency injection , and the template method are examples of design patterns that follow the inversion of control principle, although the term is most commonly used in the context of object-oriented programming . Inversion of control serves the following design purposes: To decouple the execution of a task from implementation. To focus a module on the task it is designed for. To free modules from assumptions about how other systems do what they do and instead rely on contracts . To prevent side effects when replacing a module. Inversion of control is sometimes facetiously referred to as the \"Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you\". Description In traditional programming, the flow of the business logic is determined by objects that are statically bound to one another. With inversion of control, the flow depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution. Such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions that are defined through abstractions. This run-time binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service locator . In IoC, the code could also be linked statically during compilation, but finding the code to execute by reading its description from external configuration instead of with a direct reference in the code itself. In dependency injection, a dependent object or module is coupled to the object it needs at run time . Which particular object will satisfy the dependency during program execution typically cannot be known at compile time using static analysis . While described in terms of object interaction here, the principle can apply to other programming methodologies besides object-oriented programming . In order for the running program to bind objects to one another, the objects must possess compatible interfaces . For example, class A may delegate behavior to interface I which is implemented by class B ; the program instantiates A and B , and then injects B into A .

The developer should set up a known good state before the tests, and return to the original state after the tests. Test suites A test suite is a set of tests that all share the same fixture. The order of the tests shouldn't matter. Test execution The execution of an individual unit test proceeds as follows: setup (); /* First, we should prepare our 'world' to make an isolated environment for testing */ ... /* Body of test - Here we make all the tests */ ... teardown (); /* At the end, whether we succeed or fail, we should clean up our 'world' to not disturb other tests or code */ The setup() and teardown() methods serve to initialize and clean up test fixtures . NOTE: setup() teardown() Test result formatter A test runner produces results in one or more output formats. In addition to a plain, human-readable format, there is often a test result formatter that produces XML output. Assertions An assertion is a function or macro that verifies the behavior (or the state) of the unit under test. Usually an assertion expresses a logical condition that is true for results expected in a correctly running system under test (SUT). Failure of an assertion typically throws an exception , aborting the execution of the current test.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Software-development/Software-testing/Unit-testing/xUnit/#xunit","text":"\u5f88\u591aunit testing framework\u90fd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2aframework\u3002","title":"xUnit"},{"location":"Software-development/Software-testing/Unit-testing/xUnit/#wikipedia#xunit","text":"","title":"wikipedia xUnit"},{"location":"Software-development/Software-testing/Unit-testing/xUnit/#xunit#architecture","text":"NOTE: architecture\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u638c\u63e1unit testing framework\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff1bxUnit\u7684architecture\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u3002 \u5b83\u662f\u5178\u578b\u7684multiple-task model\u7684\u3002 All xUnit frameworks share the following basic component architecture, with some varied implementation details.[ 1]","title":"xUnit architecture"},{"location":"Software-development/Software-testing/Unit-testing/xUnit/#test#runner","text":"A test runner is an executable program that runs tests implemented using an xUnit framework and reports the test results.[ 2]","title":"Test runner"},{"location":"Software-development/Software-testing/Unit-testing/xUnit/#test#case","text":"A test case is the most elemental class.
